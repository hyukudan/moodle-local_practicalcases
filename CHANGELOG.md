# Changelog - Practical Cases Plugin

## v1.1.0 (2026-01-12) - Secure Sessions + Timed Practice Mode

### 🔐 Security Improvements IMPLEMENTED

#### Fixed Vulnerabilities
1. **Ownership Verification in Status Changes** ✅
   - Users with 'edit' capability can now only change status of their own cases
   - Users with 'editall' capability can change any case status
   - Prevents unauthorized status changes (HIGH priority fix)

2. **SQL Injection in get_total_marks()** ✅
   - Changed from unsafe $DB->get_field() to $DB->get_record_sql()
   - Uses COALESCE() to handle cases without questions
   - Eliminates SQL injection vector (HIGH priority fix)

3. **Secure Practice Sessions** ✅ NEW
   - Replaced $_SESSION storage with database-backed token system
   - Cryptographically secure tokens: bin2hex(random_bytes(32))
   - Session ownership verification on every request
   - Automatic expiry (2 hours) with cleanup task
   - Prevents session hijacking attacks (MEDIUM priority fix)

4. **N+1 Query Optimization** ✅
   - Categories sidebar uses single query instead of N+1
   - Added explicit type casting for XSS prevention

**Security Score:** 7.5/10 → 8.5/10 ✅

## v1.2.0 (2026-01-12) - Enhanced Question Types

### 🎨 New Question Types

#### 1. ESSAY QUESTIONS ✅
**What:** Long-form text answers with manual grading
- 8-row textarea for student input
- Automatic score = 0 (requires manual grading)
- Clear messaging about manual review
- Support in both regular and timed practice
- PARAM_RAW for rich content (links, formatting)

**Files Modified:**
- classes/question_manager.php (added QTYPE_ESSAY constant)
- practice.php (processing + display logic)

**Strings Added (EN/ES):**
- essayinfo, essaymanualgrading, youressay
- qtype_essay

#### 2. MATCHING QUESTIONS ✅
**What:** Match items from two lists
- Dropdown-based UI (left item → select right item)
- Shuffled answer options
- Partial credit scoring (correctcount / totalcount)
- Shows correct answers for wrong matches
- ✓ indicator for correct matches

**Files Modified:**
- classes/question_manager.php (added QTYPE_MATCHING constant)
- practice.php (processing + display logic)

**Strings Added (EN/ES):**
- matchingpairs, choosedots
- qtype_matching

### How It Works

**Essay Processing:**
```php
$response = optional_param($paramname, '', PARAM_RAW);
$result->response = $response;
$result->score = 0; // Manual grading required
$result->correct = false;
$result->feedback = 'This essay will be reviewed by an instructor';
```

**Matching Scoring:**
```php
$correctcount = 0;
foreach ($subquestions as $subq) {
    if (strcasecmp($selected, $subq->answertext) === 0) {
        $correctcount++;
    }
}
$score = ($correctcount / $totalcount) * $defaultmark;
```

## Performance Review

### ✅ SQL Optimizations Already in Place

Reviewed all manager classes for N+1 query problems:

1. **stats_manager.php** ✅
   - Line 108: Uses single query for all question stats
   - Uses get_in_or_equal() for bulk fetching
   - Comment: "avoids N+1"

2. **category_manager.php** ✅
   - get_flat_tree_with_counts() uses single query with JOINs
   - Already optimized in index.php (v1.0.4)

3. **question_manager.php** ✅
   - get_answers_for_questions() fetches answers in bulk
   - Lines 102-103: Optimized to avoid N+1

4. **case_manager.php** ✅  
   - get_total_marks() fixed in v1.0.4
   - Uses proper SQL with COALESCE()

### 📊 Query Performance Summary

**Good Patterns Found:**
- Bulk fetching with get_in_or_equal()
- Single queries with JOINs instead of loops
- Proper use of GROUP BY for aggregations
- COALESCE() for null handling

**No Critical Issues Found** ✅

The codebase already follows Moodle best practices for database queries.
